Underwater flappy bird Android Project - Written (attempted) using OpenGL ES 2.0

## Project Spec/Outline

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to make a game. (research heavy)

Based on the popular video game Flappy Bird, design and implement a game that allows you to play as either a diver or fish to swim underwater, avoiding obstacles to reach their destination.

User presses up arrow or space bar (or tap screen in Android) to make diver or fish swim upwards. The diver or fish sinks toward the bottom between keypresses.

###Project Extensions:

* Diver must resurface for air before oxygen supply runs out
* Fish must avoid sharks and eat algae to score extra points
